        <p class="bottom-line wow animate__fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="1s"></p>
        <p>
          Moniker’s roots began in the corporate world, where our “Eureka!”
          moment of what inspires people to love their workplace and click
          with their colleagues led us to quit our jobs and trade in our
          cubicles for carry-ons.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal was simple. Focus on creating bucket-list worthy retreats
          for other companies around the world, helping them brainstorm in
          inspiring places, celebrate achievements, or spend some time kicking
          back and bonding in incredible settings and locations.
        </p>
        <p>So far, so good.</p>
